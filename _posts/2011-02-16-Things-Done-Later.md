A little bit ago, a friend of mine decided that there wasn't a really slick ToDo List webapp that made it nice and easy to keep track of what to do on the weekends.
So I decided to use it as an opportunity to start playing around with jQuery some more and actually get to where I was reasonably proficient with it.  2 Days and a weekend later I had a working prototype that had some basic functionality.
Now that the project has reached the stage where it should be resonably usable I'd like to get some more comments from the community and give out some plans I already have.

How does it work?
=================

The idea is that everything is sortable.  And I mean EVERYTHING.  You can sort all of your ToDos so the higher priority ones are at the top.  You can even sort your lists that way too.
And you can even sort the ToDos into other lists by dragging them around.

Ideas already suggested to me
=============================

I will likely be doing most or all of these depending on how difficult they end up to do
* Reminders -- Since I have due dates, why not send a reminder to my user about upcoming projects?
    * Email -- I ask for your address to eventually have a "Forgot my password" setup anyway
    * Twitter -- Nice and easy to do, and it lets you get them on your phone for no cost to me
    * SMS -- Very convienient for the user, but a little more difficult for me.  Would also allow for you to add or manage things over the phone
* Multiple types of lists
    * Kanban style tracking -- Likely can't call it that but would be nice
    * Gantt tracking -- Might even be possible to have it combine with Kanban
    * Generic notes -- This would combine with the SMS above very nicely to make it easy to leave a note for yourself later
* Export all data -- Very useful, I just don't know a format that makes sense yet, send me an email at ideas@thingsdonelater.com if you know of a good one.
* Nice lightweight WYSIWYG editor for the "description" on each ToDo, that way you can leave a little note for yourself about each task easier.
* Start time for ToDos -- This would play well with the Gantt stuff.
* Some minor UI tweaks -- Hiding close buttons on lists when they have things in them, or deleting ToDos for you and a few things like that.

What I plan on doing with it?
=============================

I don't plan on trying to monetize this for some time.  It's a fun project that I'm doing to try to show off my abilities to potential employers, (like most of my projects).  Incidentally, I'm looking for work so go grab my resume from http://www.simcop2387.info/resume.pdf and let me know if you've got anything for me.  I'm in the Atlanta, GA area right now and might be willing to relocate if the right offer came.
